# WEB103 Project 1 - *Listicle*

Submitted by: **Michael Girma**

About this web app: **I used Javascript, Node.js, and Express.js to create an application that introduced 5 characters from one of my favorite anime shows. It allows users to get educated on each characters role in the show, their hometown, and their ranking.**

Time spent: **9** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

<!-- Make sure to check off completed functionality below -->
